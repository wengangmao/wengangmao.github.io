Electrifying ships is a promising solution to achieve the IMO zero emission regulations. This paper first review recent development on various propulsion systems that use electricity as one of their energy sources. The pros and cons of various propulsion methods, e.g., straight shaft propulsion, shaftless propulsion and pod propulsion, will be investigated in terms of power efficiency and the applicable ships. Then, three different propulsion systems are simulated to study the energy efficiency, using different combination of power sources such as full electric, series hybrid, parallel hybrid and series-parallel hybrid. Finally, the feasibility and outlook of electrifying ships from small inland ships to ocean crossing ships to achieve zero-emission goals are analyzed, as well as major barriers to electrify ships in different shipping segments.
