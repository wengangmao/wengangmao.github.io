## Project objective
To increase energy efficiency is one of the most urgent tasks in today’s shipping industry. Various measures have been developed to help increase shipping energy efficiency. One of the most important elements for these measures is a reliable ship speed-power model, which can describe the influence of a ship’s energy performance in seaways. However, today’s models always contain large uncertainties that may hinder the development and evaluation of these measures. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to develop such speed-power models especially applicable for ship voyage optimization. First, a semi-empirical model is proposed based on experimental tests. Then, a machine learning model (black box) is developed based on large amount of full-scale measurement. The effect of various performance models on a ship’s voyage optimization solutions has also been investigated. For the semi-empirical model, the formulas to estimate a ship’s added resistance in head waves are developed to better describe a ship’s hull forms and other main particulars.
The formulas are then extended to estimate impact of wave attacking from different angles. In addition, a significant wave height based correction factor is proposed to consider nonlinear effect of a ship’s resistance and power increase in irregular waves. The semi-empirical models have been validated by both experimental model tests and full-scale measurement from three types of ships. The proposed model gives much better speed loss prediction compared to other well-known approaches. The impact of such an improvement on a ship’s voyage optimization for trajectory, sailing time accumulation, and propulsion power accumulation is also investigated. For the machine learning based model, the XGBoost algorithm is used to establish the model based on full-scale measurements of a PCTC. The input feature of the machine learning model contain parameters of ship operation profiles, metocean condition, and motion responses. On average, the machine learning model’s predictive discrepancy is less than 1% compared with the full-scale performance measurement

## Project background
The fluctuating fuel cost, low freight tariff, more rigorously environmental regulations to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are promoting innovative development of energy efficiency measures to decarbonize maritime transport. A ship’s operational life typically varies from 25 to 30 years. Increasing a ship’s energy efficiency could have a crucial impact from both shipping economic and long-term environmental perspectives (Stopford, 2009). From the economic perspective, shipping is principally a business, and the main
target is to generate profit. The bunker price has shown its volatility in the last several decades. When it exceeds 400USD/mt, the fuel consumption expense could account for 50-60% of a ship’s operating cost (Wang and Teo, 2013). From the environmental perspective, shipping is the backbone of international trade among the global economy contributing to about 80% of global trade by volume (UNCTAD, 2018). The GHG emissions from shipping increased from 977 million tonnes in 2012 to 1076 million tonnes in 2018 (9.6% increase), and the share of shipping emissions in global anthropogenic GHG emissions has increased from 2.76% in 2012 to 2.89% in 2018. It is projected that shipping induced emissions will increase up to 50% before 2050 relative to 2018 (IMO, 2020). Fossil fuel induced emissions have attracted great attentions from both public audience and authorities. The following figure shows the series of efforts made by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Two kinds of mandatory energy efficiency mechanisms have been implemented to regulate shipping energy efficiency, i.e., ship energy efficiency design index (EEDI) for new ships, and the ship energy efficiency management plan (SEEMP) for all ships in 2011, which have been mandatory since 1st of January 2013 (IMO, 2011). All these regulations aim at reducing fuel consumption and air emission from the shipping industry. In addition, the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) is introduced to monitor a ship’s energy performance during operations. The EEOI is a tool to monitor GHG emissions during a specific time period per unit of revenue tonne-miles. It is highly related to a ship’s propulsion power when sailing in seaways (IMO, 2009). The EEDI is introduced as a technical index used for new ship design, and it includes a ship’s non-dimensional coefficients and weather factor fw representing the ship speed loss in adverse weather condition (IMO, 2014) for a specific ship propulsion power. Evidently, both the EEDI and EEOI have emphasized the importance of the encountered metocean environmental impact on ship speedpower performance. For the already existing ships, the SEEMP provides a practical approach for ship operators to manage their ship operations in an energy efficiency manner over time. Various energy efficiency measures can be developed and potentially installed by ships to be complied with the regulations such as SEEMP. Among all the available energy efficiency measures, a ship voyage optimization system is one of the most attractive and widely implemented measures by the shipping industry (DNV GL, 2015). Under the help of voyage optimization, ships are able to avoid harsh weather conditions by choosing sailing routes leading to minimized fuel consumption (GHG emission), reduced risk of ship/cargo damage, and increased arrival punctuality (Simonsen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). During a ship’s voyage optimization process, models to describe the ship performance at sea are the core element for the evaluation of optimization objective functions (Wang et al., 2020; Lang et al., 2020). If the objective of the voyage optimization is to reduce fuel consumption, the reliability of the voyage optimization strongly depends on the accuracy of a ship’s speed-power relationship under various ocean environment.
