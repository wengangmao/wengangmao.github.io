# A logbook for VoySmart research activities


This log book is written as a Markdown format based on [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/start/your-first-book.html).

In order to build the markdown into html pages, you need to download:
- jupter book (build html files from markdown files)
- ghp-import  (upload html files onto Github to publish the website)

Run the following steps to compile the Jupyter book:

> 1. Go to upper level directory containing the "wengangmao.github.io" folder
> 2. Build the book by run "jupyter-book build voysmart" or "jb build wengangmao.github.io"
> 3. Enter into the "voysmart" folder
> 4. Publish the html pages by run "ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html"

Then you should be able to access the [VoySmart Website](https://wengangmao.github.io/contents/home.html)!
