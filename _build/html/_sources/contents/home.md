## Research Outcomes by Examples
The overall objectives of our research activities are to:
- **Develop models to estimate a ship's fuel consumption and maneuverability**
- **Develop models to describe the spatio-temporal correlation of metocean conditions encountered by ships**
- **Develop optimization algorithms to plan a ship's voyage with reduced fuel/emissions and enhanced safety & ETA**
- **Develop innovative measures to increase ship energy efficiency**
- **Develop control algorithms to automatically navigate a ship**

### Autonomous shipping
* How to introduce uncertain models in MPC control algorithms
* Kalmar filter or wavelet methods to get smooth u, v, r for maneuverability models of various ship propulsion systems
* RNN+LSTM learning to predict real-time ship trajectories
* Re-inforcement learning for near future path planning
* Machine learning methods to predict and forecast a ship's navigation behavior



### Spatio-temporal modelling of metocean parameters
* SPDE models and conditional prediction for short-term weather prediction
* Spatio-temporal modelling of wind and wave environments
* Spatio-temporal/SPDE metocean models to assist ship navigation
* Wave statistics to ship safety


### Machine learning for maritime applications
* ML DCP method to split stationary sea states and their applications
* Hybrid models for ship performance modelling
* How to get baselines from ML analysis
* ARIMA and LSTM for dynamic ship performance prediction (must be more accurate than ordinary machine learning methods)
