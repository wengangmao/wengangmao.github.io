## Project background
Voyage optimization systems search for a ship's potential sailing area by estimating ETA, fuel consumption, fatigue, etc., along sailing area. However, the reliability of a voyage optimization system may be affected by different uncertainties, such as weather forecast input, ship performance models, and parameter settings in optimization algorithms. This study investigates voyage planning uncertainties associated with parameter setting of four optimization algorithms. Half yearsâ€™ full-scale measurement of a containership sailing in the North Atlantic is used to study the sensitivities of voyage optimization due to parameter settings of the algorithms. Important parameter settings are summarized from the sensitivity analysis.
