## Energy efficiency measures
* Optimization of ship resistance, engine load and propulsion efficiency
* Control algorithm for CPP ship navigation
* Electrifying ships with optimization speed and battery configurations



## Autonomous shipping
* How to introduce uncertain models in MPC control algorithms
* Kalmar filter or wavelet methods to get smooth u, v, r for maneuverability models of various ship propulsion systems
* RNN+LSTM learning to predict real-time ship trajectories
* Re-inforcement learning for near future path planning
* Machine learning methods to predict and forecast a ship's navigation behavior



## Spatio-temporal modelling of metocean parameters
* SPDE models and conditional prediction for short-term weather prediction
* Spatio-temporal modelling of wind and wave environments
* Spatio-temporal/SPDE metocean models to assist ship navigation
* Wave statistics to ship safety


## Machine learning for maritime applications
* ML DCP method to split stationary sea states and their applications
* Hybrid models for ship performance modelling
* How to get baselines from ML analysis
* ARIMA and LSTM for dynamic ship performance prediction (must be more accurate than ordinary machine learning methods)
